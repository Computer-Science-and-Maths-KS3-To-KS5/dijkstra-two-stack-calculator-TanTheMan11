# Evaluation

I have achieved the goals set in the analysis of this system.

I have created a program that takes an expression consisting of numbers, operations, and brackets as input and evaluates it using the Dijkstra Two-Stack Algorithm.

I can expand on this project by evaluating more operations, such as exponentiation and modulo.
